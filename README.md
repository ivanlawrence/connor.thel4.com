# Connor's Coding Site
The goal here is to have a place you can put real code out there in the real world that is not just through some other site like jsFiddle (whicsh is awesome, but this is a little more awesomer)
# Goals:
1. make something cool
1. show it off to your family first
1. maybe show it to your friends but lets make sure its appropriate to do so <3 (thats a heart)

## Here is a new sub heading, you use two `#` for that ;)
