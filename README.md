# Hello, World!
Welcome to my little corner of the web — a place where I tinker with code, build tiny projects, and play with little experiments! 

This is the GitHub repo holding all the code for my website, which you can find [here](https://connor.thel4.com)!

Feel free to poke around, try things out, and have fun! :)

## Some small details:
* All `HTML`, `JS`, and `CSS` (for now!)
* Dark Mode, because we all know dark mode is simply better
* Mobile-friendly... Kind of
* Entirely for fun — zero stress, zero pressure... and zero quality
